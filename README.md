# ONCOGENIC COMPOUNDS CLASSIFER USING ChemBertA AND OCR

This project focuses on identifying cancer-causing ingredients in consumer products using ChemBertA. It leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract ingredient lists directly from product labels.

# Objectives:
* Use OCR technology to capture and digitize ingredient information from product packaging.
* Build a dataset of at least 10,000 chemical names.
* Train a robust FCNN model to classify ingredients as cancer-causing or safe.

# Technologies Used:
* Tesseract for OCR
* PyTorch
* NumPy & Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib/Seaborn
* Chemical Databases: (e.g., PubChem, ChemSpider)
